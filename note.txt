IN css we (in border some imp dimension coordinates to understand )

1  when you want to edit the border style so in upper and down the first code is work 
2 and in right and left borders you can code the second code to edit 
in tages activating priority is goes internal css to external 


internal css>external css

1 em = 16px 
so if example you want 40pixel but in rem so

40/16     2.5 rem
= 2.5   
 
 
 in css imp point to note :+
 when you apply css styles in any container value what you will take 
 
 so  if two css styles point one container or value so first style will point this container not second
 example one <H1>
 
 
 .color
 {
 background-color"red"
 }
 
 .color
 {
 background-color"skyblue";
 }
 now in this case it is depend on link
 
 link rel="address " 
 <h1 class =color> trial </h1>\
 
 
 
 
 
 
 when you want to add the more than one class so only you have to do is inside the one class call him only like example see
 
 <button type = "button" class =btn btn-dark btn-lg> troap</button>
  high light it btn btn-dark and btn-lg are two different classes but call in one bracket
  
  
IMP 
you insert javaScript src in html tag those place where body tag were close they reduce the load of page to much
and you cant insert javascrp sorce in head because they not see where there performence apply so mind it !!
you cant insert css linking inside body because they not work  there styling things because tags and oter attritbuts some are bellow or some top so they cant work
